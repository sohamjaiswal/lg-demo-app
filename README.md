## What does it do? 🧐
Nothing much, just displays basic programming abilities and logic... maybe ability to read docs... or to just get it done...

Being a dart and hence flutter beginner I can cite my sources (Darn you AI)

> Personal Note: Dart is pretty pog, I like how it handles class/object initializers... syntax and some inbuilt functions are similar to JS/TS as well! Definitely a language I will come back to!
